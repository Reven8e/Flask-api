To create the db go to the directory of the app.py and type in terminal 'python/3' depends on the amount of python versions u have.
after that type 'from app import db' .
and then type 'db.create_all()'

Create 'template' directory and cut all the html files to there for the app to work!!
Dont forget to install all the requirements too.
